The Airline Reservation Web Application is a sophisticated online application designed to serve various users including tourist agents, airline operators and program managers. This application offers a wide range of features aimed at improving experience. Users can search and choose from several available flights to destinations. The system allows seat selection on a graphical map of seats that can be regular, comfort, or business. Additionally, users can opt for ticket cancellation insurance. Payment by credit card is secured, and users can receive e-tickets and invoices via email. For airlines, the system provides access to passenger lists for specific flights, while the system admin can view flight details, crew details, plane details and user profiles. Registered users can enjoy exclusive benefits such as monthly upgrades, discounted airport lounges and free annual companion tickets. The system stores user information to ensure a complete database and aims for a flexible, secure, and scalable application that allows for possible changes during development. Overall, user interfaces for both clients and employees should be simple and efficient, and data management should aid in any requests made by a user.
